SpazCore is a set of libraries that make it easier to create HTML+JavaScript
applications for desktop and mobile platforms. It's *not* a framework. It
primarily exists at this point to facilitate new versions of the Spaz Twitter
client on platforms other than AIR.

## Issue Tracking

Bug reports and issue tracking is done at http://gitbug.appspot.com/projects/spazcore/. You can close bugs via a GitHub style web hook. You'll need the following details and to include the issue identifier (eg. #gitbug1234) in the commit message. For instance:

> changed settings file which fixes bug #gitbug52


## Roadmap

Initially, I'd like to target the following platforms:

* AIR
* Titanium
* Palm webOS

SpazCore is not complete. It's barely started. If you're interested in
JavaScript application development, SpazCore needs your help.

Here's what is planned at the moment:

* REQUIREMENTS: jQuery, JSON2.js
	* jQuery should be used in a non-conflicting manner at all times
* A comprehensive Twitter API Lib
* A preferences library
* A file access abstraction library
* A DB abstraction library (maybe ORM)
* A set of helper functions to make common tasks easier
	* Input filtering (security)
	* Strings
	* System and app data (versions, OS, etc)
	* File access
